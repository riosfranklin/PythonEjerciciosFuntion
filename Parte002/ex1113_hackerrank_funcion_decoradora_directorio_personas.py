# Ejercicio 1113: HackerRank Funci√≥n decoradora para formatear datos de personas.

# Let's use decorators to build a name directory! You are given some information about  people. Each person 
# has a first name, last name, age and sex. Print their names in a specific format sorted by their age in 
# ascending order i.e. the youngest person's name should be printed first. For two people of the same age, 
# print them in the order of their input.
