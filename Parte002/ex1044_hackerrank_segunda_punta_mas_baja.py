# Ejercicio 1044: HackerRank Buscar los estudiantes que tengan la segunda nota mÃ¡s baja.

# Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

# Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

# Example

# The ordered list of scores is , so the second lowest score is . There are two students with that score: . Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:

# alpha
# beta

# ....
